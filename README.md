This is an app I made following along with the course from Mosh's [React Native Series](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-react-native-course). The series covers many of the main concepts relevant to mobile Dev: 

- React Native building blocks; View, Text etc
- Expo Api
- Styling in react native
- User Inputs / Forms
- Native Features
- Navigation 
- Networking 
- Offline Support / Caching
- Authentication / Authorization 
- Notifications
- Distribution
